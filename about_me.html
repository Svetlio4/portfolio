        <h2>How I stared programming</h2>
        <p>
            I started learning about programming in 10th grade. I found it fun and
          very interesting. The first programming language that I started
          learning was C# at school. In 11th grade I found new language, Python,
          which has easy sintax to learng and is also very interesting. I
          learned Python with the begginer and fundamentals course of SoftUni,
          this is Bulgarian e-university where u can find a lot of programming
          courses. After my Python courses ended I started learning HTML5 and CSS3
          on my own. I also plan to start learning JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h2>My Education</h2>
        <p>I graduated in PGEHT "Prof. Asen Zlatarov" Pleven, Bulgaria. At school
          I learned C# and have some knowlage about it. During my education at school
          I started learning Python. I got my begginer and fundamentals certificates 
          and then I started learning HTML5 and CSS3 from internet and other free courses.
          Currently I'm a student at Veliko Tarnovo University "St. st. Kiril and Metodii" 
          with software engineering first course bachelor degree.
